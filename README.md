# List of Deep Learning related mini projects:
## 1. Generate python source using RNN:

- Trained a stacked LSTM Char sequence model on open source python code to generate source data. 
- The result is remarkable just after 50 epochs.

## 2. Sentiment Analysis using RNN:

- Sentiment analysis is typically a classification problem.
- However for a larger data set RNN can provide a better prediction than typical Machine Learning approach.

## 3. Implementation of AlexNet using PyTorch

- This implementation is an almost exact replica of the AlexNet paper in PyTorch, 
  however there are many common factors that were taken care such as Mixed Precision, Tensor Board integration etc
